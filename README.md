*Project Overview*
This analysis alone has taught me an abundance of Excel skills. Functions will probably be my biggest take away. As they were the hardest part, so I find it important to perfect those. This helped find the data needed to then go forward with visualization. Graphs, charts and pivot tables im sure are just scratching the surface. However having the ability to atleast extract and visualize for the common Joe, has already diipped my toe in the water. Simply just showing my spouse or Excel sheet sent her into mass confusion. But with my new skills I used my visualization skills to make it understandable. Which is a clear contrast of how that would play out in the business world.

*Analysis and Challenges*
I would be lying if I said I faced no challenges. Mainly trying to figure out how to upload my files to GitHub. Then later reading that i could delete sheets off of my work to compress the file. However by this point I had already gone through the absolute brain melting process of Git LFS. A fairly simple task for the initiated, but hell for a casual like myself. After an hour of doing the challenge, trying to find a way to submit, losing every single file, spending 2 hours redoing my work, and then finally calling a friend with a computer science degree. I found out how to use Git LFS! from there it was smooth sailing. Other than that the functions can be a bit challenging knowing what array's or columns to use in the formula. But with a little experimenting its a quick fix.

*Results*
1. The glaringly obvious observation is that May and June are the best dates to launch. This is repersented by the graph visualization. 
2. Over 50% of the outcomes are a failure. Which would lead me to believe that its a pretty volatile choice moving forard.
3. Outcomes based on goals showed us ranges essentialy. If we want a high success chance the best areas are $4999 and below or between $25000 to $34999 due to their over 75% suceess rate.
4. As far as limitations go I'm honestly stumped. This was already a ton of data to work with for me. The only thing i would imagine is just more information oon outliers. 
5. If ive learned one thing, its that James hates pie charts. So we dont use those. How ever we used lots of column charts but never bar. Theyre very alike so im not sure if theres a clear choice to use which when. And maybe and X Y chart to visualize more of those outliers.
